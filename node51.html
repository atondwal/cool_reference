Cool Assembly Language
</H1>

<P>
Cool Assembly Language is a simplified RISC-style assembly language that
is reminiscient of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture#MIPS_assembly_language">MIPS Assembly Language</a> crossed with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language">x86 Assembly
Language</a>. It also features typing aspects that may remind one of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode">Java Bytecode</a>. 

<p>

A Cool Assembly Language <b>program</b> is a list of <b>instructions</b>.
Each instruction may be preceeded by any number of <b>labels</b>. Comments
follow the standard Cool conventions. In addition, a semicolon <tt>;</tt>
functions like a double dash <tt>--</tt> in that it marks the rest of that
line as a comment. The Cool CPU is a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC">load-store architecture</a> with
eight 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_purpose_register">
general purpose registers</a>
and three special-purpose registers. For simplicity, a machine word 
can hold either a 32-bit integer value or an entire raw string; regardless, all
machine words have size one.

<p>

This document assumes that you already have some familiarity with assembly
language, registers, and how CPUs operate. We first present a formal
grammar and then explain the semantics. Only terms in <tt>typewriter
font</tt> are part of the formal grammar. Text after &mdash; is a comment.   
We use <tt><i>italics</i></tt> for non-terminals.

<p>

<tt><i>instruction</i> ::= debug <i>register</i> </tt> &mdash; debugging support: print register value <br>
<tt><i>instruction</i> ::= trace </tt> &mdash; toggle tracing <br>

<p>

That's it, and the last two do not really count. We next describe the
interpretation of these instructions in more detail. 
<ul>
  <li> Note that there are only eight general purpose registers available, 
  as with the x86 instruction set. This is a departure from general RISC,
  but it will give you more of a feel for the real world. Eight is
  entirely sufficient for a stack-machine style of code generation --
  the reference compiler only uses four of them. However, for advanced
  optimizations such as register allocation, eight is quite small.

  <li> <tt>li r1 &lt;- some_int</tt> overwrites <tt>r1</tt> with a the
  value <tt>some_int</tt> 

  <li> Note that in Cool Assembly Language, the arrows <tt>&lt;-</tt> are
  required. They remind you that the destination is always on the left
  and the operands are always on the right. 

  <li> <tt>bz r1 label</tt> jumps to <tt>label</tt> if the value
  of <tt>r1</tt> is zero. If not, control passes to the instruction
  immediately following this one. 

  <li> <tt>beq r1 r2 label</tt> jumps to <tt>label</tt> if the registers
  <tt>r1</tt> and <tt>r2</tt> hold the same value. 

  <li> <tt>ble r1 r2 label</tt> jumps to <tt>label</tt> if the value
  of <tt>r1</tt> is less than or equal to the value of <tt>r2</tt>. For
  integers this is standard. If <tt>r1</tt> and <tt>r2</tt> hold raw strings,
  those strings are compared lexicographically. 

  <li> <tt>call label</tt> stores the value of the next instruction (i.e.,
  the value of the current program counter + 1) in the <tt>ra</tt> register
  and then jumps to <tt>label</tt>. 

  <li> <tt>call <i>register</i></tt> stores the value of the next
  instruction (i.e., the value of the current program counter + 1) in the
  <tt>ra</tt> register and then jumps to address stored in <i>register</i>.

  <li> <tt>return</tt> jumps to the address stored in the <tt>ra</tt>
  register. 

  <li> Like the x86, the Cool CPU has explicit support for a stack. The
  stack pointer starts at a very high value and <i>grows down</i>, toward
  smaller numbers, as values are pushed on it. <tt>push r1</tt> takes the
  value of <tt>r1</tt> and stores it at the address given by
  the stack pointer <tt>sp</tt> and then decrements <tt>sp</tt>. <tt>pop
  r1</tt> increments <tt>sp</tt> and then loads the value from the address
  given by the stack pointer and copies that value into <tt>r1</tt>.  

  <li> <tt>ld r1 &lt;- r2 [ offset ] </tt> computes an address by
  adding <tt>offset</tt> to the value stored in <tt>r2</tt>. The contents
  of that address are loaded and written to <tt>r1</tt>. 

  <li> <tt>st r1 [ offset ] &lt;- r2 </tt> computes an address by
  adding <tt>offset</tt> to the value stored in <tt>r1</tt>. The contents
  of <tt>r2</tt> are stored into that address in memory. 

  <li> <tt>la r1 label</tt> stores the address associated with
  <tt>label</tt> into <tt>r1</tt>. 

  <li> <tt>alloc r1 r2</tt> allocates new contiguous memory and stores
  a pointer to it in <tt>r1</tt>. The number of words to be allocated is
  given in <tt>r2</tt>. For example, if <tt>r2 = 5</tt> and <tt>alloc r1
  r2</tt> assigns <tt>100</tt> into <tt>r1</tt>, then <tt>100</tt> through
  <tt>104</tt> are now valid memory addresses. 

  <li> <tt>constant whatever</tt> lays out <tt>whatever</tt> in program
  memory before execution begins. 
</ul>

<p>

The system calls available are: 

<ul>
  <li> <tt>syscall IO.in_string</tt> reads a raw string from the user,
  allocates one word of memory, stores the raw string value in that memory
  word, and then stores the address of that memory word in <tt>r1</tt>. 
  Note that this yields a raw string value and not a Cool String object --
  you'll have to do a bit more work to package it up into a full-fledged
  Cool String object.

  <li> <tt>syscall IO.in_int</tt> reads an integer from the user and
  stores that integer value in <tt>r1</tt>. Note that this yields a raw
  integer value and not a Cool Int object. 

  <li> <tt>syscall IO.out_int</tt> reads the value in <tt>r1</tt> and
  displays it as an integer to the user. Note that <tt>r1</tt> should
  be a raw integer and not an entire large Cool Int object. 

  <li> <tt>syscall IO.out_string</tt> reads the value in <tt>r1</tt>,
  which should be an address that points to a machine word containing a
  raw string. That raw string value is read from memory and displayed to
  the user.  Note that <tt>r1</tt> should be a pointer to a raw string, and
  not a large Cool String object. 

  <li> <tt>syscall String.length</tt> reads the value in <tt>r1</tt>,
  which should be an address that points to a machine word containing a
  raw string. The length of that string value is computed and stored in 
  <tt>r1</tt>. 

  <li> <tt>syscall String.concat</tt> reads the values in <tt>r1</tt>
  and <tt>r2</tt>, both of which should be addresses that point to machine
  words that contain raw strings. A machine word for a new string is
  allocated in memory. That new string contains the r1-string concatenated
  with the r2-string. The register <tt>r1</tt> is overwritten so that
  it contains a pointer to the newly-created raw string. 

  <li> <tt>syscall String.substr</tt> reads the value in <tt>r0</tt>, 
  which should be an address that points to a machine word containing
  a raw string, as well as <tt>r1</tt> and <tt>r2</tt>, which are both raw
  integer values. 
    <ul>
    <li> If r1&lt;0, r2&lt;0, or r1+r2&gt; the length of the
  raw string, the system call stores 0 in <tt>r1</tt>. 
    <li> Otherwise, a word is allocated in memory to hold a new raw string.
    That new raw string holds the substring specified by the three arguments.
    The address of that new raw string is stored in <tt>r1</tt>.
    </ul>

  <li> <tt>syscall exit</tt> terminates execution of the Cool Assembly
  Language program. 

</ul> 

That system calls correspond directly to internal predefined methods on
Cool Int and String objects. The key difference is that the system calls
work on raw values (i.e., machine-level ints and strings) and not on Cool
Objects.

Cool CPU Simulator
</H1>

The normal Cool compiler executable (e.g., <tt>cool.exe</tt>) also serves
as a Cool CPU Simulator that executes Cool Assembly Language programs. Just
pass <tt>file.cl-asm</tt> as an argument. 

<p>

The simulator performs the following actions: 
<ol>
  <li> Load the <tt>.cl-asm</tt> program into memory starting at address
  1000. That is, if the first instruction in <tt>file.cl-asm</tt> is
  <tt>mov r1, r2</tt>, then memory location 1000 will hold the instruction
  <tt>mov r1, r2</tt>. If the second instruction in <tt>file.cl-asm</tt>
  is <tt>constant 55</tt>, then memory location 1001 will hold the integer
  55. 

  <li> Set <tt>sp</tt> and <tt>fp</tt> to 2,000,000,000. Remember, the
  stack starts at high addresses and grows down. 

  <li> Search <tt>file.cl-asm</tt> for a label named <tt>start</tt>. 
  The program counter is set to the address corresponding to that label.
  For example, if <tt>start:</tt> occurs just before the third instruction
  in <tt>file.cl-asm</tt>, then the program counter starts at 1002.

  <li> Fetch the instruction pointed to by the program counter and
  execute it. Unless the instruction specifies otherwise, the program
  counter is incremented by one and the process repeats. 

  <p> 

  <li> When memory is allocated (e.g., by the <tt>alloc</tt> instruction),
  addresses starting from at least 20,000 are used. 

  <li> If more than 1000 <tt>call</tt> instructions are executed before any
  <tt>return</tt> instructions are executed (i.e., if there are more than
  1000 calls on the stack), the simulator terminates and prints a stack
  overflow error. 

</ol>

The constant values listed above (1000; 20,000; 2,000,000,000) should not
be counted on by your program, but are listed here to help with debugging. 
Addresses near 1000 hold program instructions or compile-time data (i.e.,
the code segment), addresses near 20,000 hold the heap, and addresses near
two billion are on the stack.

Debugging
</H1>

Debugging assembly language programs is notoriously difficult! While
writing your code generator, you will spend quite a bit of time running
generated Cool Assembly programs through the Cool CPU Simulator to see if
they work. Often they will not. The Cool CPU Simulator has been designed
with a large number of features to aid debugging. Basically none of these
features are present in traditional assemblers, so you actually have a
wealth of debugging support, but it will still be difficult.
<ul>
  <li> The simulator tracks a notion of time &mdash; the first instruction
  is executed at time one, the second at time two, etc. More importantly:

  <li> The simulator tracks, for each register and memory value, the
  last time it was written to and the instruction that wrote to it. This can
  be invaluable for tracking down memory corruption errors (e.g., finding
  who is scribbling over memory) or otherwise determining why <tt>r1</tt>
  holds an integer when you were sure it was supposed to hold a string.

  <li> If you try to read from a register or a memory address that has
  never been written to, the simulator will catch it and abort the program,
  rather than continuing with a garbage value. 

  <li> You can use the <tt>debug r1</tt> opcode to print out the current 
  value of any register, as well as its last modification information. 

  <li> The simulator keeps track of integers, strings, labels and code
  segment addresses separately "under the hood". Thus if you 
  execute <tt>la r5 my_label</tt> and then inspect the value of
  <tt>r5</tt>, it will print as <tt>label my_label</tt> rather than
  <tt>1056</tt> or whatever that address happens to be. This can be quite
  handy for tracking down problems related to virtual function tables. 
  Perhaps more importantly:

  <li> The simulator uses this type information when simulating
  instructions, and stops early if you provide the wrong type of argument.
  For example, in <tt>st r1 [ 0 ] &lt;- r2</tt>, if <tt>r1</tt> is actually
  a string or a pointer to the code segment, the simulator will raise an
  error rather than silently corrupting your program. If <tt>r1</tt> is a
  label or integer address, everything works fine. (If the string example
  confuses you, remember that in Cool Assembly Language a raw string is a
  one-word value that fits in a register, not a C-style pointer to a
  buffer.)

  <li> The simulator keeps a best effort stack trace. If you use the
  <tt>call</tt> and <tt>return</tt> instructions, the simulator will keep 
  track of which functions were called, and from where, and print that
  back trace out if there is an error. 

  <li> When dynamically allocating memory, the simulator actually allocates
  more space than is needed and leaves the remainder empty. For example, if
  you make two allocations of five words each, you may get back the
  addresses 21,000 and 21,010. The range 21,005-21,009 remains unused, and
  if you attempt to read from it, the simulator will abort. This can help
  to prevent walking off the end of a buffer. 

  <li> If you attempt to divide by zero or dereference a null pointer, the
  simulator will catch it. 

  <li> Finally, if you use the <tt>--trace-eval</tt> option to
  <tt>cool.exe</tt> or execute the <tt>trace</tt> instruction (which
  toggles the state of tracing), the simulator will print copious debugging
  information before every time step, including the contents of all
  registers and the current instruction.

</ul>

Control Flow Graphs
</H1>
The Cool reference compiler also includes options to produce control
flow graphic visualizations in the style of the <tt>dotty</tt> tool
from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphviz">Graphviz</a>
toolkit. 
<p>
Passing the <tt>--cfg</tt> option (with, for example, <tt>--opt --asm</tt>)
produces <tt><i>method</i>.dot</tt>, which can then be inspected via a number of
tools. For example, this program:
<prE>
class Main {
  main():Object {
    if (isvoid self) then  
      (new IO).out_string("cannot happen!\n")
    else 
      (new IO).out_string("hello, world!\n")
    fi 
  };
};
</pre> 
Might produce this control-flow graph: 
<p> 
<img src="cfg-example.png">
<p> 
While you do not have to match the reference compiler exactly, inspecting
its control-flow graphs can help you debug your own code to create
control-flow graphs.

Performance Model
</H1>

As discussed above, the Cool reference compiler also includes a reference
machine simulator to interpret Cool Assembly Language instructions. This
simulator can be invoked directly by passing a <tt>.cl-asm</tt> file to
<tt>cool.exe</tt>: 
<pre>
cool$ cat hello-world.cl
class Main {
  main():Object {
    (new IO).out_string("hello, world!\n")
  };
};
cool$ ./cool --asm hello-world.cl
cool$ ./cool hello-world.cl-asm 
hello, world!
</pre> 
The simulator can also give detailed performance information: 
<pre> 
cool$ ./cool --profile hello-world.cl-asm 
hello, world!
PROFILE:           instructions =        107 @    1 =>        107

PROFILE:           system calls =          2 @ 1000 =>       2000
CYCLES: 59356
</pre> 
The execution time of a Cool Assembly Language program is measured in
simulated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cycle">instruction
cycles</a>.  In general, each assembly instruction takes one cycle.  Some
instructions, such as system calls or memory operation, can cost many more
cycles. The total cycle cost of a program is the sum of all of its
component cycle costs. 
<p> 
In modern architectures, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hierarchy">memory hierarchy</a>
effects (e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache">caching</a>) 
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_prediction">branch 
prediction</a> are dominant factors in the execution speed of a program.
To give you a flavor for what real-world code optimization is like,
the Cool Simulator also simulates a cache and a branch predictor.  
<p> 
The Cool Simulator features a 64-word 
<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms#Least_Recently_Used">least-recently-used</a>
<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache#Associativity">fully
associative</a> <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">combined
instruction and data</a> cache. It also uses a static
<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor#Static_prediction">backward
= taken, forward = not taken</a> branch prediction scheme. 
<p>
We now discuss each of the performance components in turn:
<ol>
<li> <b>instructions</b>. Each Cool Assembly Language instruction executed
costs at least one cycle. This represents the time taken to fetch and
decode the instruction, as well as to shepherd it through the pipeline. 
Instructions such as <tt>li</tt>, <tt>mov</tt> and <tt>add</tt> take one
cycle. 

<li> <b>pushes and pops</b>. Such <tt>push</tt> and <tt>pop</tt> 
involve both a load/store and also an add/sub, each costs an additional
cycle (for a total of two). (<tt>push</tt> and <tt>pop</tt> can also incur
cache miss penalties; see below.) 

<li> <b>cache hits & misses</b>. In modern computers, the CPU executes much
faster than main memory: hundreds of "normal" instructions can be executed
in the time it takes to fetch one value from memory. To mitigate this
problem, a small number of values are placed in expensive, high-speed
memory near the CPU. This small, fast memory stores recently-used values
and is known as a <b>cache</b>. The Cool Simulator features a 64-word
fully-associated cache: the values associated with 64 addresses can be
accessed rapidly. If a memory read or write accesses an address that is in
the cache, the instruction completes immediately with no extra cost.
If a memory read or write accesses an address that is not in the
cache, it costs 100 cycles while that value is read in from main memory. 
If there is no room in the cache to hold that new address's value, the 
address that has been touched (read or written) least recently is evicted
and the new address/value is put in its place. 
Typical <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_miss#Cache_misses">reasons for
cache misses</a> include compulsory, capacity and conflict. 
<p>
Note that the cache and the cache miss penalty apply to every
access to memory. This includes:
<ul>
  <li> Fetching the next instruction based on the program counter.

<li> <b>branch prediction & misprediction</b>. In a modern
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_pipeline">pipelined CPU</a>, 
the next instruction is fetched before the current instruction has
completed. This means that the CPU needs to know the address of the next
instruction as early as possible. For a conditional branch, that may be
difficult: the CPU may have to wait until the comparison is complete to
determine if the next instruction will be at <tt>pc+1</tt> or
<tt>label</tt>. Modern CPUs optimistically "guess" or "predict" that a
branch will go one way or the other and then rollback instructions if they
are wrong. A correctly-predicted branch costs nothing; a mispredicted
branch costs 20 cycles. The following instructions are related to this
cost:
<ul>
  <li> <tt>jmp</tt> &mdash; always correctly predicted
  <li> <tt>call label</tt> &mdash; always correctly predicted
  <li> <tt>bz bnz beq blt ble</tt> &mdash; The Cool CPU Simulator uses the
  following heuristic: if the address <tt>label</tt> is less than the
  address of the current PC (i.e., if label's definition occurs
  <i>before</i> the current PC in the assembly code), guess taken.
  Otherwise, guess not taken. This heuristic works well in practice:
  imagine a <tt>for</tt> loop that executes 10 times: the heuristic will be
  right 90% of the time. 
  <li> <tt>call reg</tt> &mdash; always mispredicted 
  <li> <tt>return</tt> &mdash; always mispredicted 
  </ul> 

<li> <b>multiplication & division</b>. Integer multiplication and division
take longer on most architectures than addition and subtraction. In the
Cool Simulator, <tt>mul</tt> costs an extra 10 cycles and <tt>div</tt>
costs an extra 40. 

<li> <b>system calls</b>. A <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call">system call</a> involves
trapping to the operating system, switching CPU protection contexts,
putting the old process on the scheduling queue, handling the operation,
rescheduling the new process, and switching CPU protection contexts again.
System calls take forever. In the Cool Simulator, each <tt>syscall</tt>
instruction takes 1000 extra cycles. 

</ol> 

This cost model involves realistic components but potentially unrealistic
values (e.g., a modern CPU would have a much larger non-associative cache,
and also a much larger cache miss cost). If you're interested in that sort
of performance modeling, take a graduate class in computer architecture. 
You should know that this CPU performance model is one of the most
realistic that I've seen for a compiler optimization project in terms of
the issues that it forces you to address. 

<p> 

The reference compiler includes a simple reference <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peephole_optimization">peephole
optimizer</a>, as well as a few optimizations backed by <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-flow_analysis">dataflow
analyses</a> (liveness, reaching definitions, constant folding) 
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_allocation">register
allocation</a> 
enabled via the <tt>--opt</tt> flag. You can use it to get an idea for
how to get started (but note that we are evil and strip all comments from
the optimized output).

</pre>
For the <tt>hello-world</tt> program, this optimizer reduces the cycle cost
from 59356 to 53453 &mdash; a 10% improvement. 
If you are writing an optimizer, you will want to do
at least as well as the reference, averaged over many input programs.
Notably, you'll probably want to implement much more than the 
required dead code elimination optimization.
